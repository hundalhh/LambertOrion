<pre>

The uploaded files describe applications of the LambertW function to the original Master of Orion (1993) game. 

I am still writing the main document.  Every file listed below is just supporting docmumentation for the 
main document.   


ApproximationLambertW.pdf  - describes a few ways to estimate the Lambert Growth Rate and the LambertW function
	                     (Copied from StackExchange)
BankerProblem7.pdf         - describes the first banker's problem and its solution.
BankersSecondProblem5.pdf  - describes the second banker's problem and its solution.
BoundRatio3.pdf            - gives some bounds for the expression  ( log(b) - log(a) )/(b-a) where a and b
                             are positive real numbers.
secondBanker.py            - is a python program that illustrates the second banker's problem
simBank1.py                - is a python program that illustrates the first banker's problem
simpleOrionSim2.py         - is a python program that shows how the the Lambert Growth Formula
                             gives a pretty good approximation of the growth rate of the economy
			     for an extremely simplified version of Master of Orion
